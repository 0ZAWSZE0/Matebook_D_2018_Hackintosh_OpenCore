<details>

<summary>Show more</summary>

#### 2020-Mar.-9  Update to Opencore 0.5.5

1. Temporarily remove `SMCBatteryManager`. Turn to use` ACPIBatteryManager` which performs better.
2. Thanks to [iStarForever](https://github.com/XStar-Dev) for making a battery hot patch `SSDT-BAT1-HUAWEI` for this machine, which fixes some battery errors in ACPI.
Â In addition, a power state repair method by RehabMan was refferd, [click here for details](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/solved-battery-charging-and-status-update-problem.263737/page-3)

3. Added `SSDT-PTSWAK` to fix the problem of the power re-electrified to DGPU after waking up.

4. Use the `Preset Variable Method` to enable GPIO interrupt for touchpad. Discard ` SSDT-OC-XOSI`

5. Due to the increase of ACPI customized content, support for `Honor Magicbook 2018` is removed. You can refer to [here](https://github.com/hjmmc/Honor-Magicbook) for Honor Magicbook 2018.

6. Force to load the dynamic tables related to `_PPC`.

7. If you need to boot `Windows 10` by OpenCore , please read the related documents to add support.

#### Earlier status
<details>
<summary>Show more</summary>

* Based on OpenCore Official Release ~~0.5.3~~ 0.5.5

* Native NVRAM works.

* Soundcard with injected Layout-ID 21 works well.

* ~~CFG Lock cannot be unlocked in Huawei's fxxking BIOS. However everything just works. I'm not able to modify the confusing InsydeH2O BIOS now.~~
    The way to modify BIOS is found, I'll update later to explain how to unlock CFG and change DVMT.

* Replaced stock Intel Wireless 8265AC with BCM94360CS2 and an adapter. Using [AirportBrcmFixup](https://github.com/acidanthera/AirportBrcmFixup) with `brcmfx-country=#a` to enable all WiFi channels.

* Use [one-key-cpufriend](https://github.com/stevezhengshiqi/one-key-cpufriend) to gain a better CPU power management. However, a CpuFridendDataProvider generated by yourself is needed if you have an i5-8250U version of Matebook D 2018 or Magicbook 2018 Intel edition.)

* DGPU nVidia MX150 is disabled by SSDT-DDGPU.

* **Use `USBInjectall.kext` to avoid potential USB map differences. However, customizing your own `USBports.kext` by [Hackintool](http://headsoft.com.au/download/mac/Hackintool.zip) is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. You can read the help document inside for more details.**


* ~~This EFI may also works on Magicbook 14 Kabylake-R. However, Layout-ID may need to set as `56` or `57` ( May need more modifications)~~

* You may need to use your own System-UUID when you need dual boot with Windows 10.  

* Minor bugs: 
    1. ~~Screen backlight requires a second-open to turn on after closing lid.~~    
    Now fixed by `SSDT-LID-Wake-After-Sleep` ,thanks to [hjmmc](https://github.com/hjmmc) : [Honor-Magicbook](https://github.com/hjmmc/Honor-Magicbook)    
    I added an `_OSI`  determination to meet the needs of dual boot with Windows/Linux by OpenCore though it's not recommended.  

    2. Trackpad doesn't work and a USB mouse is needed when installing.  
* If you have an NVMe ssd and want to have a better battery life, have a try on NVMeFix.kext.  

* ~~Added `SSDT-TPD0.dsl` for touchpad GPIO interrupt mode, in case of you don't want dirty `SSDT-XOSI`.~~

## Something related to `ACPI Errors`
This hackintosh EFI may have some minor ACPI problems related to `Dynamic OEM Tables`, which is a set of SSDTs generated by firmware dynamically in terms of current power status of your computer. These tables transfer current power status to the system by `_PPC`, which will also called by `_QA6` under `EC0`, are related to CPU power management.   

Itâ€˜s weird that these tables cannot loaded by OpenCore automatically. What's worse, macOS may unbootale while stucking at APCI Errors related to `_QA6` and `_PPC`.    

A solution to this problem is making these tables force loaded by bootloader. 
1. Boot your Matebook D or Magicbook 2018 with `Clover`,
2. Press `F4` to dump your `ACPI Tables`.
3. Find all of Dynamic SSDTs, which has an `x` ahead of serial number. <br>For example, `SSDT-x3_0-Cpu0Ist.aml` ,`SSDT-x3_1-ApIst.aml`......
4. Put all these `Dynamic SSDTs` into EFI/OC/ACPI
5. "ADD" these SSDTs into OpenCore under `config.plist--ACPI--Add`, just refer to the form of other SSDTs' "registeration". 
6. Reboot and check whether you got a **Zero** ACPI Error boot log lol !

## Screenshot & How I put BCM94360CS2 into the laptop

You can find such adpter on Taobao or AliExpress, here is one of them: [link](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/4000291280536.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.5db01c7b2QBTqJ&algo_pvid=58e27c50-cfd3-4b1d-a47b-0844639975b7&algo_expid=58e27c50-cfd3-4b1d-a47b-0844639975b7-20&btsid=0b86d81615848848784222166ea9b6&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_)

Also, DW1820A / 00JT493 / 00JT494 works great on Matebook D 2018 though some features like Auto Unlock by Apple Watch or turning hotspot on iPhone from bluetooth won't function.
